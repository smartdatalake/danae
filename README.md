# Danae

## Overview
DANAE is an open-source system for finding similar datasets in a data lake.

We regard two datasets as similar if (i) they are akin in content, sharing one or more columns with similar features and/or (ii) are characterized by similar metadata, such as title, description and keywords.

We develop a dataset search engine that supports this combined search, providing also a Web-based user interface to allow users to navigate, search, and explore datasets in the data lake.
